# Sources
**US name history** is US government data, from the Social Security Administration (SSA).

See this link for full info: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html

Counts for baby names come from: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip

Proportion values for the US overall were calculated using: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/numberUSbirths.html

Proportion values for the state data are calculated simply as a proportion of all births reported in the file. This is actually not quite correct, because it ignores babies born with less popular names, but it is a reasonable approximation given what we have available.
